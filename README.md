## Centralized testing software
### The program simulates the calculation of the result for centralized testing.

### Task:
The software should include several basic testing items. For the Russian and Belarusian languages, assign tasks with several variants of answers in Part A. The calculation of the final test ball must be performed using the weighting factors of the complexity of each task. This program should independently form the applicants' forms in a given amount. To create a custom form, make a choice: generate a program or download ready. Answers to assignments for the relevant items can be presented in the form of numbers or words. All data on forms, coefficients, answers, the number of correctly executed tasks should be saved to files for viewing and analysis.
To develop a software for DH, it is necessary to implement the following functions:

• Software generation of responses for all test tasks.

• Formation of applicants' forms.

• Counting the number of applicants who correctly completed the assignment.

• Determination of the weighting coefficients of tasks.

• Save all data to a text file.

• Download data from a text file.

• A score for a multi-choice task.

• Automatic verification of results.

• Save the history of passing the test to a file.
